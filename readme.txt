Allows Pages to have a stub that is only a number. Sacrifices the paged content ability in Pages to accomplish it.

== Description ==

It is not possible to have a page slug (the page's name in the URL) that is a number. For example this will not work: `yoursite.com/about/2/`. That URL conflicts with paged content feature where you can posts and pages with multiple pages of content by adding `<!--nextpage-->` within your content.

This plugin allows you to have  Pages with numbers as stubs by giving up the ability to have paged content pages which isn't a big deal as most people don't use paged content pages anyway.
