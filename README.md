# Allow Numeric Slugs

A WordPress plugin that allows pages to have a slug (URL) that is only a number.

Normally is not possible for a page to have a URL like `yoursite.com/about/2/` (a page called "2" that's a child of "About"). That URL conflicts with paged content feature where you can posts and pages with multiple pages of content by adding `<!--nextpage-->` within your content.

This plugin allows you to have pages with numbers as slugs by giving up the ability to have paged content pages which isn't a big deal as most people don't use paged content pages anyway.
